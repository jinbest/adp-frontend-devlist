The individual that I spoke with was extremely professional and honest. I was lucky that the damage was not as bad as I had thought, obviously they are the experts! They could have easily kept the phone and charged me what they originally quoted, and I would have never known the difference, but they didn't. I will not hesitate to use them in the future and will definitely recommend them to anyone I come across with a damaged phone.",
